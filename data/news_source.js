    summary: 'Our latest research on LNG weathering has been published in the prestigious Energy journal.',
    link: 'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.02.174',
    content: `We are proud to announce that our research paper on vapour phase heat transfer modeling for LNG weathering has been published in Energy journal.

This work presents a realistic model for predicting the weathering behavior of liquefied natural gas (LNG) stored in large tanks, which is crucial for the design and operation of LNG facilities.

# Key Findings:
- Improved accuracy in predicting boil-off gas rates
- Better understanding of thermal stratification effects
- Practical guidelines for tank design optimization

This research was conducted in collaboration with industry partners and represents a significant advance in the field of cryogenic storage systems.`
